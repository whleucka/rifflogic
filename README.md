# RiffLogic

Guitar practice tool. Scales, chords, and a Guitar Pro tab viewer with multi-track playback.

Built with vanilla JS, Web Audio API, and FluidSynth (WASM).

## Running

Serve the project root with any static file server. The YouTube integration requires the proxy:

```bash
cd server && npm install && node index.js
```

Needs `yt-dlp` installed for YouTube audio streaming.

### Tab viewer

GP files (.gp5/.gp6/.gp7) are unzipped in-browser (jszip), parsed from GPIF XML, and rendered to a canvas. The layout engine dynamically groups measures into systems based on content width, with proportional beat spacing and minimum note distance enforcement.

Notation supported: hammer-on/pull-off arcs, slides (shift/legato/in/out), bends, natural harmonics, vibrato (Songsterr-style zigzag), palm muting, tuplet brackets, ties, pick strokes, rhythm stems with beaming.

Lessons learned, rabbit holes, and things worth remembering.

### FluidSynth + SGM-V2.01.sf2

The SF2 file is 247MB. Loading it into FluidSynth WASM is expensive. We lazy-load it and cache in IndexedDB so subsequent loads skip the network fetch. Even so, initial parse time in WASM is noticeable.

The `ScriptProcessorNode` bridge between FluidSynth and Web Audio is a known bottleneck. Buffer size is 8192 samples — smaller values cause glitches, larger values add latency. There's no good answer here until AudioWorklet integration is solid. The worklet file exists (`js-synthesizer.worklet.js`) but reliability varies across browsers.

Tried multiple soundfonts before settling on SGM-V2.01. Most GM soundfonts are either too large (500MB+) or sound terrible for guitar. SGM-V2.01 is a reasonable compromise — decent acoustic/electric guitar patches, full GM coverage for multi-track playback, and the file size is manageable with caching.

Karplus-Strong is the default voice and sounds surprisingly good for single-note lines. FluidSynth kicks in when you need accurate GM program changes across tracks (e.g., clean vs. overdriven guitar, bass, keys).

### YouTube sync

This was the biggest time sink. The goal: play a YouTube backing track synchronized with the tab scrolling/playback.

**The proxy approach**: Browser can't fetch YouTube audio directly (CORS). The server uses `yt-dlp` to grab audio, caches it locally (500MB cap, 24h TTL), and streams it back with range request support for seeking.

**Sync problems**: YouTube audio and MIDI-scheduled tab playback drift. The tab player uses `AudioContext.currentTime` for scheduling, but the YouTube audio element has its own clock. Small timing differences compound over a 5-minute song. We added a user-adjustable offset slider (-30s to +60s) so you can manually nudge the sync. Not perfect, but workable.

**What didn't work**:
- Trying to use the YouTube IFrame API for audio — too much latency, no precise time control
- Attempting to sync via `requestAnimationFrame` polling — jittery, especially under CPU load
- Auto-detecting offset from audio analysis — way too complex for the payoff

The current approach (manual offset + `yt-dlp` streaming) is ugly but reliable.

### GP file parsing

Guitar Pro files are ZIP archives containing GPIF XML. The format is mostly undocumented. We reverse-engineered the structure by comparing output against Songsterr and other GP viewers.

Key gotchas:
- **Vibrato encoding**: Can appear as `<Property name="Vibrato">` inside `<Properties>` OR as a direct `<Vibrato>Slight|Wide</Vibrato>` child element on `<Note>`. Some files use one, some use the other, some use both. You have to check both.
- **Slide flags are a bitmask**: `1`=shift slide, `2`=legato slide, `4`=slide out down, `8`=slide out up, `16`=slide in from below, `32`=slide in from above. The parser originally treated it as a boolean.
- **Tuplet rendering**: Triplet brackets belong below the staff (near rhythm stems), not above. HOPO chains inside tuplets (e.g., 11-12-11) look best as a single spanning arc from first to last note, not individual per-note arcs.
- **Tied notes across systems**: Ties that cross system breaks need special handling — arc to the end of the current system, then a continuation arc at the start of the next.

### CPU / performance

Canvas rendering with 200+ measures, each with multiple voices and annotations, gets heavy. Key optimizations:
- Static canvas (staff lines, notes, annotations) is rendered once and cached
- Overlay canvas handles the playback cursor and is redrawn incrementally
- Layout computation is pure math (no DOM) — runs once on load/resize
- FluidSynth scheduling uses a 150ms lookahead window to batch note events

Still-open issue: very dense passages (32nd note runs) with lots of annotations can cause visible frame drops during playback, especially on lower-end machines.

### Note spacing

Purely time-proportional spacing looks wrong when short and long notes are adjacent (e.g., a 16th note followed by a half note). The layout engine uses a weighted approach with a power curve (`beatFrac^1.1`) to compress subdivisions slightly, plus a hard minimum pixel distance between consecutive beats to prevent overlap.
